# Elvira API

A web-based application to get prediction prizes for a Belgian real estate market - a studying project at [BeCode](https://becode.org).

## The Mission

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" is really happy about our regression model. Now they would like us (and me) to create an API to let their web developers build a website around it.

## Instuctions

Currently, this repo consists 3 folders:
- API     = all the code related to API itself.
- Docker  = files needed to containerize our app and deploy it.
- Docs    = files related to an explanatory website about API usage.

## Contact

In case of any question, here is my contact [page](https://nicesoul.me/contact)

If you want to check out other variations of this API, built by my groupmates, please, let me know - I will redirect you to the best ones.
